# Phishing Detection Web App

This directory contains a selfâ€‘contained web application that lets you interactively classify emails as phishing or safe, and explore humanâ€‘readable explanations for the modelâ€™s verdicts.

## Folder Content

* **`__init__.py`** â€“ Marks this folder as a Python package.
* **`chat_bot.py`** â€“ Entrypoint for the web server; defines routes and launches the app.
* **`front_end_setup.py`** â€“ Bundles and builds frontâ€‘end assets (JS/CSS) before you start the server.
* **`get_model_predictions.py`** â€“ Wraps your locally trained models (logistic regression, XGBoost) to produce verdicts and raw XAI outputs.
* **`get_llm_prediction.py`** â€“ Queries the DeepSeek LLM API to classify and explain emails using an LLM.
* **`explanation_processing.py`** â€“ Postâ€‘processes raw explanations into one of three flavors
* **`README.md`** â€“ (This file.)

To use the web_app you have to do several things:

1. **Set your DeepSeek API key**

   The LLMâ€‘based explanation and classification rely on DeepSeekâ€™s API. Before building or running the app, export your key:

   ```bash
   export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-<your-key>"
   ```

2. **Download and put other models into the right place**

...


3. **Build the front end**

   This compiles any JavaScript/CSS needed by the UI:

   ```bash
   python3 -m Web_app.front_end_setup
   ```

5. **Open in your browser**

   Visit `http://localhost:7860` (or the port printed in your console) to start classifying emails.

## How It Works

1. **User Settings**
   * Chose what you want to detect:
     * Phishing
     * Machine generated mails
   * Choose one of the available models:

     * **Local models**: logistic regression, XGBoost, Bert-Lime, Bert-Shap.
     * **LLM model**: DeepSeekâ€™s `deepseek-chat` endpoint.
   * Pick an explanation style:

     * *Raw XAI output* (exact model explanation)
     * *Slightly enhanced* (concise rephrase)
     * *Greatly simplified* (plainâ€‘language summary)

2. **User interaction**
    1. Paste a mail into the box on the top left
    2. Click analyze
   3. A verdict and confidence of the verdict are displayed and the explanation of it
   4. If interested ask the chat-bot for more details about the classification

## Tips & Troubleshooting

* **Missing API key?** Youâ€™ll see authentication errors when calling DeepSeek. Doubleâ€‘check `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set.
* **Rebuild front end** after changing any UI files: `python3 -m Web_app.front_end_setup`.
* **Logs** for classification and explanation steps are printed to the console if you run in debug mode.
