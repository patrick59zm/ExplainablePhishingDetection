Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually
atomic?  I cannot find any MSDN docs that say so (and I've seen some that
suggest to me that it probably isn't).

If it's not atomic, then this doesn't offer any advantage over shutil.move that
I can see (and in fact would damage the usefulness of os.rename, which is
currently atomic on all platforms AFAIK, even though it cannot succeed all the
time).

If MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING miraculously turns out to be atomic, then my
opinion is:

  * this feature would be very useful, and I would like a cross-platform way to
    do this in Python.
  * this feature should not be called ""os.rename"", which for years has done
    something else on some platforms, and so changing it will invite unnecessary
    breakage.  A new function would be better, or perhaps an optional flag.  I
    propose ""os.atomic_rename"".

Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that.  I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

Does MoveFileEx solve the atomicity problem that Guido raised in that thread?  I
don't think it does, so I think the situation is still the same.

Summaries
=========

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP

- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Contributing thread:

- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
`__

-------------------------
HTTP Responses and Errors
-------------------------

In 2xx HTTP responses mean that the request was handled OK.  The
existing library was special-casing the most common responses and
treating others as errors.  After verifying that there wasn't a good
reason for the old behavior, Facundo Batista fixed it.

Contributing thread:

- `HTTP responses and errors
`__

------------------------
Build Problem on Windows
------------------------

It is a generated file; the actual problem is in make_buildinfo

Contributing thread:

- `build problem on windows: unable to find getbuildinfo2.c
`__

--------------------------
BaseException Pickle Issue
--------------------------

Exceptions are now new-style classes; this caused some obscure
problems with picking and unpickling.

   http://www.python.org/sf/1498571

and later

   http://www.python.org/sf/1692335

should resolve the issue.

Contributing thread:

- `BaseException pickle issue
`__

---------------------------------
Deprecating BaseException.message
---------------------------------

Plans changed; BaseException will still accept an args tuple, so don't
bother with the .message attribute. Probably the shorted leaved Python
feature ever. See PEP 352.

Contributing thread:

- `deprecating BaseException.message

Changes to decimal.py
---------------------

The external standard has been updated; python's implementation will
be updated to match.

Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list

An announcement that the (normally quiet) doc-sig mailing list would
be discussing a rewrite of pydoc.

Contributing thread:

- `Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list.

Making builtins more efficient
------------------------------

Andrea Griffini posted a patch at sourceforge that makes builtin
lookups almost as fast as locals.

Michigan, Danish agricultural engineers have built [1]a robot to help
farmers with weeds. The Hortibot is about 3-foot-by-3-foot, is
self-propelled, and uses global positioning system (GPS). It can
recognize 25 different kinds of weeds and eliminate them by using its
weed-removing attachments. It's also very environmentally friendly
because it can reduce herbicide usage by 75 percent. But so far, it's
only a prototype and the Danish engineers need to find a manufacturer for
distribution.""

system to replace vinyl records; Russell envisioned a system which could
record and replay sounds without any physical contact between parts.""

[0]warning businesses of the migration challenges that lie ahead as they
move to Vista. The article notes what an unusual step it is for a company
of Dell's size to be ""toning down its sales pitch for Microsoft's Vista
operating system"" ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ particularly because ""one of the issues the hardware
vendor is warning business about is the extra hardware they will need to
buy."" Quoting: ""'They need to be looking at the number of images they
will be installing and the size of these images,' said Dell's European
client services business manager, Niall Fitzgerald. 'A 2GB image for each
user will have a big impact.'""

An anonymous reader lets us know of developments in a case in Belgium
that has been under litigation since 2004. The Belgian copyright watchdog
SABAM has [0]forced an ISP to begin filtering P2P traffic (PDF).
According to the PDF on the SABAM site: ""The Belgian Society of Authors,
Composers and Publishers (SABAM) has just won an important legal battle
within the context of the dispute that opposes it to the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) Tiscali, which has become Scarlet Extended Ltd. In its
sentence of June 29, 2007, the Court of First Instance of Brussels is
demanding from the access provider that it adopts one of the technical
measures put forward by the expert in order to prevent Internet users
from illegally downloading SABAM's musical repertoire via P2P software.""
The rumor is that Scarlet will be forced to deploy the same software as
MySpace uses ([1]Audible Magic) to filter illegal P2P traffic from the
legal.

six million users will no doubt be delighted they can use their leftover

Just days after the Russian Government shut down AllofMP3.com, its sister

[0]tregetour writes with a link to a New York Times article penned by
David Pogue about a quiet announcement last week by T-Mobile. It has
nothing to do with the iPhone, but it could still be a welcome revolution
for users plagued by high cellphone bills. ""Here's the basic idea. If
you're willing to pay $10 a month on top of a regular T-Mobile voice
plan, you get a special cellphone. When you're out and about, it works
like any other phone; calls eat up your monthly minutes as usual. But
when it's in a Wi-Fi wireless Internet hot spot, this phone offers a huge
bargain: [1]all your calls are free. You use it and dial it the same as
always ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ you still get call hold, caller ID, three-way calling and all
the other features ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ but now your voice is carried by the Internet rather
than the cellular airwaves."" He goes on to explain further benefits of
the system, and describes the wireless routers that the company will be
pushing with the service. The only thing missing: an estimate of when it
will hit stores.

An anonymous reader writes ""The Chinese capital city of Beijing is now
[0]a global leader in distributing viruses. According to UK-based managed
security services company Network Box, Beijing accounts for 40 percent of
all viruses that passed though the company's servers in June, and 5.25
percent of detected spam. This compares with slightly lower percentages
for cities in countries noted for having a malware problem. Moscow was
second for spam with 5.12 percent, Seoul third with 3.58 percent, Turk in
Turkey fourth with 3.4 percent, and London in fifth place at 2.47
percent. 'As more and more users come online in China, there's a good
chance those computers are using pirated software without up-to-date
security fixes, making them prime targets for hackers who are actually
located elsewhere in the world, [Simon] Heron said. Those compromised
computers, which are used to send spam and make it more difficult to
identify the spammer, are so valuable that hacker gangs have been
competing to take over machines. If one gang finds a machine running
another gang's Trojan horse program ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ one that appears harmless to the
victim but can be used to control a machine ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ they'll try to remove the
software.'""

bill, [1]published last week, would include the prohibition of fictional
depictions of violence and images of acts between consenting adults. The
law would also apply to screenshots taken from a legal film, if the
screenshot was made for erotic purposes. The goal is to prevent disturbed
individuals from accessing content online that would trigger violent
behavior. From the article: 'Labour MP Martin Salter, who has worked
closely ... in pushing the legislation, rejected the BDSM community's
claims their civil liberties were being undermined. He said: ""No-one is
stopping people doing weird stuff to each other but they would be
strongly advised not to put it on the internet. At the end of the day it
is all too easy for this stuff to trigger an unbalanced mind.""' The bill
follows from plans [2]initially announced last August.""

notes that IBM's workhorse continues to do important work in a number of
enterprise environments. ""While there are some out there who'd like to
see its demise, a true threat to the Big Iron has never really amounted
to much. Even today, the proponents of commodity boxes offering less
expensive x86/x64 or RISC technologies say the mainframe is doomed. But
the facts say otherwise. For example, IBM recently said the mainframe has
achieved three consecutive quarters of growth, marked by new customers
choosing the platform for the first time and existing customers adding
new workloads, such as Linux and Java applications.""

voice plan you get a special cellphone when you are out and about it works like any other phone calls eat up your monthly minutes as usual but when it is in a wi fi wireless internet hot spot this phone offers a huge bargain all your calls are free you use it and dial it the same as always you still get call hold caller id three way calling and all the other features but now your voice is

a malware problem moscow was second for spam with percent seoul third with percent turk in turkey fourth with percent and london in fifth place at percent as more and more users come online in china there is a good chance those computers are using pirated software without up to date security fixes making them prime targets for hackers who are actually located elsewhere in the world simon heron said those compromised computers which are used to send spam and make it more difficult to identify the spammer are so valuable that hacker gangs have been competing to take over machines if one gang

Michigan, Danish agricultural engineers have built [1]a robot to help
farmers with weeds. The Hortibot is about 3-foot-by-3-foot, is
self-propelled, and uses global positioning system (GPS). It can
recognize 25 different kinds of weeds and eliminate them by using its
weed-removing attachments. It's also very environmentally friendly
because it can reduce herbicide usage by 75 percent. But so far, it's
only a prototype and the Danish engineers need to find a manufacturer for
distribution.""

medium in the world for playing back and storing music, is often disputed
as one individual did not invent every part of the compact disc. The most
attributed inventor is James Russell, who in 1965 was inspired with a
revolutionary idea as he sketched on paper a more ideal music recording
system to replace vinyl records; Russell envisioned a system which could
record and replay sounds without any physical contact between parts.""

[0]Steve Jones writes ""With the EU being rumored to look at software
patents again I thought I'd have a look at the root of the problem  the
US Patent Office  and work out if there is [1]a simple way to defeat
dumb patents. The big thing that defeats a patent is prior art. At the
Patent Office they have the definition of Prior Art that includes the
phrase: 'known or used by others in this country, or was patented or
described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country.' Now
suppose that every time we have an idea that we think is 'obvious' but
that hasn't been done before, or something we think would be interesting
but don't have the money to create  that we blogged about that idea,
tagging it as 'prior art' via [2]Technorati. This would give people an
[3]RSS feed of prior art."" Read on for more details of Steve's proposal.

Mattaburn writes with a story up on ZDNet UK reporting that Dell is
[0]warning businesses of the migration challenges that lie ahead as they
move to Vista. The article notes what an unusual step it is for a company
of Dell's size to be ""toning down its sales pitch for Microsoft's Vista
operating system""  particularly because ""one of the issues the hardware
vendor is warning business about is the extra hardware they will need to
buy."" Quoting: ""'They need to be looking at the number of images they
will be installing and the size of these images,' said Dell's European
client services business manager, Niall Fitzgerald. 'A 2GB image for each
user will have a big impact.'""

An anonymous reader lets us know of developments in a case in Belgium
that has been under litigation since 2004. The Belgian copyright watchdog
SABAM has [0]forced an ISP to begin filtering P2P traffic (PDF).
According to the PDF on the SABAM site: ""The Belgian Society of Authors,
Composers and Publishers (SABAM) has just won an important legal battle
within the context of the dispute that opposes it to the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) Tiscali, which has become Scarlet Extended Ltd. In its
sentence of June 29, 2007, the Court of First Instance of Brussels is
demanding from the access provider that it adopts one of the technical
measures put forward by the expert in order to prevent Internet users
from illegally downloading SABAM's musical repertoire via P2P software.""
The rumor is that Scarlet will be forced to deploy the same software as
MySpace uses ([1]Audible Magic) to filter illegal P2P traffic from the
legal.

rather than currently shipping ones which would beat the (hypothetical)
score AMD claims for the future Barcelona. I guess while even the much
slower 2.0GHz Barcelona is due soon AMD didn't think results from the 2.0
would look good enough  even against the slower Xeons they picked. Maybe
the right comparison should be either best cpu against best cpu  or
compare ones at the same price  and only shipped products.""

[0]tregetour writes with a link to a New York Times article penned by
David Pogue about a quiet announcement last week by T-Mobile. It has
nothing to do with the iPhone, but it could still be a welcome revolution
for users plagued by high cellphone bills. ""Here's the basic idea. If
you're willing to pay $10 a month on top of a regular T-Mobile voice
plan, you get a special cellphone. When you're out and about, it works
like any other phone; calls eat up your monthly minutes as usual. But
when it's in a Wi-Fi wireless Internet hot spot, this phone offers a huge
bargain: [1]all your calls are free. You use it and dial it the same as
always  you still get call hold, caller ID, three-way calling and all
the other features  but now your voice is carried by the Internet rather
than the cellular airwaves."" He goes on to explain further benefits of
the system, and describes the wireless routers that the company will be
pushing with the service. The only thing missing: an estimate of when it
will hit stores.

An anonymous reader writes ""The Chinese capital city of Beijing is now
[0]a global leader in distributing viruses. According to UK-based managed
security services company Network Box, Beijing accounts for 40 percent of
all viruses that passed though the company's servers in June, and 5.25
percent of detected spam. This compares with slightly lower percentages
for cities in countries noted for having a malware problem. Moscow was
second for spam with 5.12 percent, Seoul third with 3.58 percent, Turk in
Turkey fourth with 3.4 percent, and London in fifth place at 2.47
percent. 'As more and more users come online in China, there's a good
chance those computers are using pirated software without up-to-date
security fixes, making them prime targets for hackers who are actually
located elsewhere in the world, [Simon] Heron said. Those compromised
computers, which are used to send spam and make it more difficult to
identify the spammer, are so valuable that hacker gangs have been
competing to take over machines. If one gang finds a machine running
another gang's Trojan horse program  one that appears harmless to the
victim but can be used to control a machine  they'll try to remove the
software.'""

An anonymous reader writes ""The BBC reports on the row over proposals by
the UK Government to [0]criminalize possession of 'extreme' porn. The
bill, [1]published last week, would include the prohibition of fictional
depictions of violence and images of acts between consenting adults. The
law would also apply to screenshots taken from a legal film, if the
screenshot was made for erotic purposes. The goal is to prevent disturbed
individuals from accessing content online that would trigger violent
behavior. From the article: 'Labour MP Martin Salter, who has worked
closely ... in pushing the legislation, rejected the BDSM community's
claims their civil liberties were being undermined. He said: ""No-one is
stopping people doing weird stuff to each other but they would be
strongly advised not to put it on the internet. At the end of the day it
is all too easy for this stuff to trigger an unbalanced mind.""' The bill
follows from plans [2]initially announced last August.""

[0]coondoggie passed us a NetworkWorld blog post about the [1]incredible
rock-em-sock-em mainframe. Knocked frequently in recent years, the site
notes that IBM's workhorse continues to do important work in a number of
enterprise environments. ""While there are some out there who'd like to
see its demise, a true threat to the Big Iron has never really amounted
to much. Even today, the proponents of commodity boxes offering less
expensive x86/x64 or RISC technologies say the mainframe is doomed. But
the facts say otherwise. For example, IBM recently said the mainframe has
achieved three consecutive quarters of growth, marked by new customers
choosing the platform for the first time and existing customers adding
new workloads, such as Linux and Java applications.""

[0]athloi writes ""Despite the tough times for albums, the music industry
is [1]slowly but surely learning the most important lesson of all: give
consumers what they want, and they happily open their wallets. Digital
music sales are a new business and a new way of thinking about and
interacting with content. The industry should be paying closer attention
to its meteoric rise and less attention to the dying, arcane album. It
should absolutely drop the rhetoric about how piracy is destroying the
business, because the sea change in sales patterns shows that something
else is is afoot. It means that when users are sitting at a computer and
looking for music, more and more each year are turning to legal download
services.""

Agreed. I rotate learning mailboxes to historical names monthly.

In other words, everybody has SpamAssassin-SPAM and SpamAssassin-HAM mail 
folders that sa-learn processes nightly, then on the first of the month 
those get moved to somthing like SpamAssassin-x-YYYYMM.

In addition, the script that launches sa-learn only tells it about 
learning folders that have been modified in the last three days.

hmm. hurt like hell? I think that's very Dr. specific. I got a shot that 
was eased in slowly, front loaded with lidocane, back loaded with 
cortisone. It was almost painless, the pain I was experiencing before 
the shot disappeared almost immediately due to the lidocane, and then 
disappeared in a more ongoing basis due to the cortisone. Magic.
